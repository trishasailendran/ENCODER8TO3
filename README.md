# ENCODER8TO3
# AIM
To simulate and synthesis encoder using Xilinx ISE.
# SOFTWARE REQUIRED
Xilinx 14.7 Spartan6 FPGA.
# PROCEDURE
STEP:1 Start the Xilinx navigator, Select and Name the New project. 

STEP:2 Select the device family, device, package and speed. 

STEP:3 Select new source in the New Project and select Verilog Module as the Source type.

STEP:4 Type the File Name and Click Next and then finish button. Type the code and save it. 

STEP:5 Select the Behavioral Simulation in the Source Window and click the check syntax. 

STEP:6 Click the simulation to simulate the program and give the inputs and verify the outputs as per the truth table. 

STEP:7 Select the Implementation in the Sources Window and select the required file in the Processes Window.

STEP:8 Select Check Syntax from the Synthesize XST Process. Double Click in the FloorplanArea/IO/Logic-Post Synthesis process in the User Constraints process group. UCF(User constraint File) is obtained.

STEP:9 In the Design Object List Window, enter the pin location for each pin in the Loc column Select save from the File menu.

STEP:10 Double click on the Implement Design and double click on the Generate Programming File to create a bitstream of the design.(.v) file is converted into .bit file here.

STEP:11 On the board, by giving required input, the LEDs starts to glow light, indicating the output.
